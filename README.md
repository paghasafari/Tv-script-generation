# Tv-script-generation

# Introduction
In this project, I've generated Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. 
I've used Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons (data directory) to build the Neural Network which is able to generate a new, "fake" TV script.

# Directory Structure

* The jupyter notebook file "dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb" contain the main code.
 
* The "helper.py" and "problem_unittests.py " are used for loading the text file and preprocess the input data and testing each block of code.
